title: 3D deformable object
category: '2'
id: 3d_deformable_object
image: ../../assets/project_2_deformable_object.gif
running_status: Running with GIGABYTE p35k at 115 ~ 145 fps.
implementation_details: 3D deformable object is implemented by Processing 3.0 version. User could control the action of the object generated in the scene through keyboard. And the angle of view could also be manipulated by mouse. We chose mass-spring method to implement our 3D deformable object. Implemented its collision with boundary. We generated ball for this simulation but haven't make ball collision with deformable object successfully so we didn't add it to scene.
problem_faced: 
- <ul> Finding suitable spring constant(ks) and damping factor(kd) which may result in undesirable animation and action of cloth when set those to unfitting values.</ul>  
- <ul> Generated ball but confronted problem in implementing collision. </ul>
